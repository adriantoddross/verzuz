# Verzuz Preview
The Verzuz Preview app lets users compare two artists' top 20 songs. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is powered by the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/).

## MVP Goals

- Users can search for two artists
- After searching, users can see the two artists side by side with their top 20 songs

### Stretch Goals

- Users can download an image of two artists, head to head so they can share it to social media
- Create a database/schema/models to hold user upvotes
- Add social login to prevent abuse & score cheating
- Allow users to manually upvote an artistâ€™s top 20 songs for a battle
